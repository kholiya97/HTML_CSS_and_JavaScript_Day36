                            Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems 
                            to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable
                            insights from data across a broad range of application domains. 
                            Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

                        <p>
                            Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.
                            It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. 
                            However, data science is different from computer science and information science. 
                            Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.

                        <h2>Third Article</h2>
                        <p>
                            Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see big data), and applying the knowledge and actionable insights from data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains.
                            The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains.
